# GymAI — Workout Plan Generation & AI Chatbot Audit

**Scope:** React Native app (`gymai`), Firebase backend, questionnaire → plan generation → workout tracking → weekly regeneration → AI chatbot.
**Method:** Full read of the questionnaire flow, navigation, state management, `generateWorkoutPlan.js`, `firebaseWorkoutHistory.js`, `chatService.js`, all main workout screens, and the exercise-builder screens, plus a repo-wide grep for AI/backend/scheduling patterns. No code was changed.
**Bottom line up front:** the app has no backend — it is a pure React Native client talking directly to Firestore, a public ExerciseDB mirror, and Groq's chat API, with both a Groq and an (unused) OpenAI key bundled into the client. Plan generation is 100% rule-based (not LLM-based, despite the app's name), largely ignores the questionnaire data it collects, and never looks at a user's workout history. The chatbot is a stock LLM call with no knowledge of the user, their plan, or their history. Neither "week 2 is generated from week 1" nor "the AI is grounded in the user's actual plan" is true today.

---

## 1. Current Architecture Summary

- **Client:** React Native 0.79 / React 19, React Navigation (native-stack + bottom-tabs), Redux (`redux`/`react-redux`, but only used for a single `workoutPlan` + `loading` slice), a custom `UserContext` (React Context) for the user profile, and `AsyncStorage` used only to remember the logged-in user's email.
- **No backend.** There is no `functions/` directory, no Node/Express service, no cron/scheduler of any kind (confirmed by a repo-wide grep — the only "schedule" hits are UI copy strings and npm's internal `scheduler` package). Every screen talks **directly** to Firebase Firestore/Auth via the `@react-native-firebase/*` SDKs.
- **Data store:** Cloud Firestore. Key collections found:
  - `Users/{autoId}` — profile/questionnaire data, queried by email (not by `uid`) in `UserContext`.
  - `workouts/{uid}` — the current week's plan (`weekStart`, `nextPlanDue`, `plan`, `createdAt`, `source`), one document per user, overwritten on every (re)generation.
  - `users/{uid}/workoutHistory/{autoId}`, `users/{uid}/exerciseHistory/{autoId}`, `users/{uid}/exerciseWeights/{exerciseId}` — completion/PR history, written by `firebaseWorkoutHistory.js` (`WorkoutHistoryService`).
- **External services called directly from the client, with keys shipped in the app bundle:**
  - `https://exercisedb-api.vercel.app/api/v1` — a public, unauthenticated third-party exercise database mirror, called via `axios` from `generateWorkoutPlan.js`.
  - `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` — the chatbot, model `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, called via `axios` from `chatService.js` using `GROQ_API_KEY` pulled from `.env` via `react-native-dotenv` (`@env`).
  - An `OPENAI_API_KEY` also sits in `.env` but is **never referenced by any file in the app** — it's dead, unused, and exposed for no functional benefit.
- **State management:** no React Query, no SWR, no caching layer of any kind, despite that being the team's normal stack. Each screen does its own `firestore()` calls with local `useState`/`useEffect` for loading/error handling — inconsistent in rigor across screens.
- **Testing:** a single boilerplate `App.test.tsx`; no unit tests over the plan generator, history service, or chatbot.

## 2. Current Workout-Generation Flow

`Questionnaire → Firestore("Users") → UserContext → WorkoutGenerating screen → generateExerciseDBWorkoutPlan(userData) → Firestore("workouts/{uid}").set() → Home/Myplan UI`

- **Trigger:** `WorkoutGenerating.js`, on mount, calls `generateExerciseDBWorkoutPlan(userData)` where `userData` comes straight from `UserContext` (i.e., whatever was last written to the `Users` collection).
- **Generator (`src/services/generateWorkoutPlan.js`, ~2,450 lines, class `ExerciseDBWorkoutGenerator`):** entirely **rule-based/deterministic** (plus one randomized step). It is **not** an LLM call — there is no OpenAI/Groq/Gemini call anywhere in this file. "ExerciseDB" refers to a live third-party REST API (`exercisedb-api.vercel.app`) with a ~33-exercise hardcoded local array as a fallback when the API is unavailable.
- **Algorithm:** normalize `goal` and `gymExperience` → pick a static split template (Push/Pull/Legs-style, one of 5 goal-specific tables) sized to `weeklyWorkoutCommitment` → for each day, map the day-type label to muscle groups via keyword matching → pull exercises for each muscle group from the API (or local fallback), filtered by a coarse `availableEquipment` match, filtered again for "beginner-unsafe" keywords only if `gymExperience` is beginner → randomly pick a fixed count per muscle group (Fisher–Yates shuffle) → attach **identical, hardcoded sets/reps/rest values for every exercise on the day**, keyed only by `goal × experience level`.
- **Fields collected by the questionnaire but never read by the generator (confirmed by grep — zero matches):** `currentDiet`, `currentPhysique`, `dietaryPreferences`, `energyLevel`, `fitnessChallenge`, `foodAllergies`, `goalPhysique`, `sleepHours`, `waterIntakeLiters`, and the free-text `modifications` field (injuries/limitations). `age` and `gender` are copied into the plan's display header only, never used to change exercise selection or volume.
- **Validation before saving:** only checks the plan isn't structurally empty (`totalExercises > 0`). No check on individual exercises, no duplicate-across-week check, no equipment re-verification, no sets/reps sanity check.
- **Storage:** `firestore().collection("workouts").doc(uid).set({...})` — a full overwrite, not a merge, and not preceded by a read of the existing document.
- **Display:** Home.js computes "today" as `(daysSinceWeekStart) % weekly_split.length` and renders that day's exercises; Myplan.js shows all 7 days from the Redux-cached plan.
- **On failure:** the screen shows a typed error UI (`network`, `validation`, `generation`, `unknown`) with a retry button and a "create manually" escape hatch (`ManualWorkout.js`) — reasonable UX, but two of the four error branches (`TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK_ERROR`) are **dead code**, because the generator swallows all network failures internally and silently falls back to the local exercise list rather than throwing.
- **Is it actually personalized?** Only weakly. It reliably differentiates by **goal, experience level, equipment, and days/week** — but `normalizeGoal()` does an *exact* string match against only 8 hardcoded phrases, while the questionnaire offers 8 different goal options (`Strength Training, Powerlifting, Health, Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, Body Recomposition, General Fitness, Athletic Performance`). Only `Muscle Gain` and `Weight Loss` match; the other **six options silently fall back to the generic "Build Muscle" template** with no error or log. Combined with the ignored fields above, most users are getting a materially less personalized plan than the questionnaire implies.

## 3. Current Weekly-Update Flow

- **Detection exists, automation does not.** `Home.js` has a `checkPlanExpiry()` effect that compares `nextPlanDue` (set at generation time to `weekStart + 7 days`) to `now` and sets a `planExpired` flag. When true, it shows a full-screen "Your Plan Has Ended" overlay with a button.
- **That button just re-runs first-time generation.** Pressing it (or the always-visible "Regenerate Plan" CTA) navigates to `WorkoutGenerating` with `{ regenerate: true }`, which calls the **exact same** `generateExerciseDBWorkoutPlan(userData)` used for week 1. There is no `generateNextWeek(userData, previousWeekHistory)` path — the file exports only one generation function, and it has no concept of "which week number" it's building.
- **No history is read.** `WorkoutGenerating.js` never imports or calls `WorkoutHistoryService`. Regeneration is a pure function of the (mostly-ignored) profile snapshot plus fresh randomization — completed workouts, missed workouts, PRs, and feedback have zero influence on the new week.
- **Regeneration destroys data.** Because the write is `.set()` (not `merge: true`), and `PullPushDay.js` separately stores `plan.completed_workouts.{day}` on that same `workouts/{uid}` document, regenerating a plan **wipes any in-progress completion tracking for the week that was just replaced**, with no read-before-write reconciliation.
- **No automatic trigger.** There is no scheduled job (none exists — no backend), and nothing runs regeneration proactively. If the user doesn't open Home.js and doesn't notice/press the button, the plan just sits expired indefinitely, while the day-index math (`daysSinceWeekStart % split.length`) keeps silently cycling through the *same* stale week's content as if it were current — the "expired" banner and "what to show today" logic are computed independently and can visibly disagree.
- **Concurrency:** no lock, no transaction, no idempotency token on generation. Two near-simultaneous regenerate calls (double-tap, two devices) both write; last write wins non-deterministically.

## 4. Current Chatbot Flow

- **Model/API:** Groq's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, called directly from the RN app (`src/services/chatService.js`) with the API key embedded in the client via `@env`. (Note: this file's internal header comment still calls itself `groqService.js` — a rename that wasn't fully cleaned up.)
- **Prompt construction:** none, in the "system prompt" sense. The request body is just the last 10 turns of an **in-memory, module-level** `conversationHistory` array plus the user's new raw message — no system role, no persona, no safety instructions, no user data.
- **User context available to the model:** **zero.** `JimAI.js` (the chat screen) passes only the raw typed string to `chatService.sendMessage()`. There is no `UserContext`, Redux, or Firestore read anywhere in the chat path. The model has no way to know the user's name, goal, equipment, current plan, or history.
- **Persistence:** none. History lives only in a JS variable for the life of the app process — a full app restart wipes it, and even within one session the chat screen's own visible message list resets to a single greeting bubble on remount (a UI/data desync, since the underlying service-level history would still be intact in memory but isn't reloaded into the UI).
- **Concrete consequence:** if a user asks *"why did you give me squats today?"* or *"I couldn't complete 3 sets yesterday, what should I do?"*, the model has no plan and no history to reference — any answer that sounds specific to "your plan" is fabricated, not grounded. There is no RAG, no function-calling, no tool access to Firestore.
- **Safety/hallucination handling:** none — no system-level guardrails for medical/injury questions, no disclaimer logic, no token-usage cap beyond the 10-turn history trim and a flat `max_tokens: 1024`.
- **Error handling:** basic — rate-limit (429) and generic network errors are caught and shown as canned chat bubbles; reasonable as far as it goes, but errors are folded into the chat transcript rather than a distinct UI state.

## 5–8. Problems Found

### Critical (fix before doing anything else)

1. **Live API keys shipped in the client bundle.** `.env` contains a real OpenAI key and a real Groq key, pulled into the JS bundle at build time via `react-native-dotenv`. Both are trivially extractable from any built APK/IPA (string literals in a JS bundle are not meaningfully obfuscated). **Rotate both keys immediately and treat them as already compromised** — this is true independent of anything else in this report, and independent of whether OpenAI is even used (it currently isn't, which makes that key pure unnecessary exposure).
2. **The chatbot cannot answer questions about the user's own plan.** No profile, plan, or history is ever injected — every "personalized" answer it appears to give is coincidental, not grounded.
3. **Plan generation ignores most of the data the questionnaire collects.** `currentDiet`, `currentPhysique`, `dietaryPreferences`, `energyLevel`, `fitnessChallenge`, `foodAllergies`, `goalPhysique`, `sleepHours`, `waterIntakeLiters`, `age`, `gender`, and the injury/limitation free-text field (`modifications`) are all collected and all unused by the generator. There is **no injury-awareness at all** — nothing prevents an exercise being assigned that the user explicitly flagged as unsafe for them.
4. **`normalizeGoal()` silently mis-routes 6 of 8 goal options** to a generic "Build Muscle" template via exact (not fuzzy) string matching, with no error or log — most users' stated goal is quietly ignored.
5. **Week-to-week continuity does not exist.** Plan generation never reads prior completion, performance, or feedback data; regenerating a plan is functionally identical whether the user completed 100% or 0% of the prior week. This directly contradicts the desired "Week 2 built from Week 1" behavior.
6. **Regeneration destroys the current week's completion record** (`.set()` instead of a merge/transaction), because completion data (`plan.completed_workouts`) and the plan document share one Firestore doc with no reconciliation.
7. **Two disconnected "finish workout" write paths.** Finishing via `PullPushDay.js` writes only a raw `plan.completed_workouts.{day}` flag and never calls `WorkoutHistoryService` — so workouts finished that way never appear in workout history, streaks, PR tracking, or the Statistics screen. Finishing via `StartFullWorkoutScreen.js` does call the history service correctly. Depending on which button a user happens to tap, their data either exists or silently doesn't.
8. **No automatic weekly regeneration.** There is no backend, so there is no scheduled job. The entire "auto-generate next week" requirement in the product spec does not exist today — it's a manual button gated behind the user opening the Home screen and noticing an overlay with no reminder mechanism.
9. **`EditRoutine.js` will crash** (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`) the moment a user taps "Edit" on any exercise, because it reads `exercise.sets`/`exercise.reps` directly while every real exercise object nests those fields under `exercise.workoutDetails.{sets,reps}`.
10. **No concurrency control** on plan generation or completion writes — no transactions, no in-progress lock server-side (only a client-side `isGenerating` flag that doesn't survive across devices/tabs).

### Medium

- Equipment vocabulary is duplicated and inconsistent across four independent places (onboarding options, the generator's matcher, `AddExercise.js`'s fallback list, `ManualWorkout.js`'s inline list). This has already produced a live bug: the onboarding option **"Dumbells"** (missing a "b") never matches the generator's `"dumbbell"` substring check, so users who select it never get dumbbell exercises from the filter. `"Squat rack"`, `"Back extension"`, and `"Pull up/Dip bars"` also match nothing and are silently dropped.
- **No way to edit goal, equipment, experience, or frequency after onboarding.** `EditProfile.js` only edits name/contact/weight/height. The profile that drives generation is frozen forever after the first questionnaire pass, even though "Regenerate Plan" implies it should reflect current circumstances.
- **Statistics screen shows fabricated placeholder data** as if it were real whenever the stats fetch fails or returns null, with no visual indication it's a fallback — a user could believe they have real muscle-group history that doesn't exist.
- No exercise-level validation anywhere (equipment mismatch, malformed IDs, duplicate-across-week, volume sanity) despite this being explicitly wanted.
- Chat history is fully ephemeral and desynced from the visible UI on remount (see §4).
- Full questionnaire object (name, age, height, weight, goals, etc.) is logged unconditionally via `console.log` in `WorkoutGenerating.js`.
- No error boundary anywhere in the app — a render-time exception on a malformed plan object would white-screen rather than degrade gracefully.
- `FormTipsLibraryScreen.js`'s "form tips" are identical boilerplate sentences for every exercise (template-interpolated, not exercise-specific), despite the screen's name implying curated content.
- No React Query (or any caching/retry layer) anywhere, despite it being the team's normal stack — every screen hand-rolls loading/error state with varying rigor.
- The generator's only external exercise source is an unauthenticated, unofficial public mirror (`exercisedb-api.vercel.app`) with no SLA — a single point of failure with no visibility into uptime or licensing terms.
- Dead code: unreachable "Clear Chat History" button in `JimAI.js`, unreachable delete-confirmation modal in `PullPushDay.js`, a `GROQ_API_KEY` import in `generateWorkoutPlan.js` from a `../config/keys` file that doesn't exist in the repo (and is never used even if it resolved).

### Nice-to-have

- Progressive-overload and deload-week logic.
- Richer exercise metadata: difficulty, movement pattern, contraindications, substitution graph (see §12).
- Push notifications / reminders when a plan expires or is close to expiring.
- One canonical exercise catalog shared by the generator, the manual builder, and the exercise-add screens (currently four independent lists).
- Dedicated, structured RPE/pain-input UI on workout completion.
- Consolidate the ad hoc `Colors`/`Fonts` objects redefined locally in several screens (e.g., `WorkoutGenerating.js` redeclares its own theme constants instead of importing `constants/theme.js`).

## 9. Recommended New Architecture (Hybrid, Not "Ask an LLM for a Plan")

Keep a **deterministic programming engine as the source of truth**, and use AI only where judgment/language is genuinely needed — never for arithmetic or safety-critical decisions.

```
React Native (no API keys, no direct 3rd-party calls)
        │  (Firebase Auth ID token)
        ▼
Firebase Cloud Functions (callable + scheduled)
        │
        ├─ Deterministic Programming Engine (ported/hardened version of today's
        │  generateWorkoutPlan.js logic — exercise selection, split templates,
        │  volume/sets/reps rules, equipment & injury filtering, progression rules)
        │      │

        │      • rewrites free-text goal/limitation notes into structured tags
        │        the engine consumes

           direct database access
        │
        ▼
Firestore (source of truth) → React Native reads via React Query
```

**What stays code/rules (never delegate to an LLM):** exercise database & metadata, equipment/injury filtering, sets/reps/rest/volume tables, weekly split templates, muscle-group balance, duplicate/overtraining checks, progression math, and all final validation. **What AI is good for:** interpreting free text, choosing among already-safe options for variety/preference, writing explanations, and powering the chatbot's language — always downstream of the engine, always re-validated before being trusted.

## 10. Recommended AI Model/API

The app already has a working, low-latency integration with **Groq** (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) for chat — keep that for the chatbot's conversational turns (fast, already proven in this codebase), but consider `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for noticeably better reasoning quality on plan-related questions, and move the call server-side.

For the new structured-JSON work (goal/preference interpretation, weekly rationale generation, AI-assisted validation), add **Google's Gemini API**. As of the current official pricing page (checked live for this audit), **Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite both show "Free of charge" input and output tokens on the free tier**, with strong native JSON-schema/structured-output support and generous context for injecting a user's history — a good fit for this workload. Gemini 2.0 Flash is no longer listed on the current pricing page, so don't plan around it. Google does **not** publish exact free-tier RPM/RPD/TPM figures on the pricing page itself — check the live numbers in Google AI Studio's rate-limit page at implementation time, since these change over time and are usage-tier dependent; don't hardcode assumed figures into capacity planning.

**Recommendation for now (dev/testing):** Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite for structured plan-personalization/validation calls (cheapest, JSON-native, currently free), Groq (existing key, now moved server-side) for the conversational chatbot. **Never call either from the React Native app directly** — always via the Cloud Functions broker in §9, so no key ever ships in a client bundle again. Self-hosted/open-source models (e.g., via a hosted inference endpoint) are worth revisiting once usage justifies the ops cost, but add real infrastructure burden the current one-person/small-team setup doesn't need yet.

*Sources: [Gemini API Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), [Gemini API Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits), [Groq Rate Limits](https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits).*

## 11. Recommended Prompt Strategy

Never send a large freeform paragraph. Send a small, structured JSON object and demand strict structured JSON back (Gemini's `responseSchema`/JSON mode, or Groq's JSON mode where available):

```json
// INPUT to the AI personalization step (not the whole plan — just the parts needing judgment)
{
  "goal": "Athletic Performance",
  "experience": "intermediate",
  "freeTextNotes": "bad left knee, avoid deep squats",
  "candidateExercisesByMuscleGroup": {
    "quadriceps": [{"id": "ex_112", "name": "Leg Press"}, {"id": "ex_045", "name": "Goblet Squat"}],
    "hamstrings": [{"id": "ex_078", "name": "Romanian Deadlift"}]
  },
  "recentPerformance": {"avgRPE": 6.2, "completionRate": 0.83, "flaggedPain": ["left knee"]}
}
```

```json
// REQUIRED output shape — engine re-validates every field before trusting it
{
  "selectedExerciseIds": ["ex_112", "ex_078"],
  "excludedExerciseIds": ["ex_045"],
  "exclusionReasons": {"ex_045": "user-flagged knee limitation"},
  "progressionSuggestions": [{"exerciseId": "ex_078", "action": "increase_reps", "amount": 1}],
  "coachNote": "Swapped in Leg Press instead of Goblet Squat to protect your knee this week."
}
```

Keep temperature low (0.2–0.4) for this task — it's selection/classification, not creative writing. The AI **never** invents an exercise ID, never sets sets/reps/rest directly (the engine does), and every `selectedExerciseIds` value must exist in the candidate list it was given — reject and fall back deterministically if not.

## 12. Recommended Exercise Database Structure

Today's schema (`{id, name, bodyPart, equipment, target, instructions}`, no difficulty/movement-pattern/contraindication fields, and duplicated across 4 files) should be replaced by one canonical collection:

```
{
  id, name, aliases: string[],
  primaryMuscle, secondaryMuscles: string[],
  equipment: string[],              // canonical enum, not free text
  movementPattern: "push" | "pull" | "squat" | "hinge" | "carry" | "rotation" | "isolation",
  exerciseType: "compound" | "isolation" | "cardio" | "mobility",
  difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
  beginnerSuitable: boolean,
  defaultVolume: { goal: { sets, repsRange, restSeconds } },   // per-goal defaults, not one global table
  contraindications: string[],      // e.g. "knee", "lower_back", "shoulder"
  substitutes: string[],            // other exercise ids, same muscle+pattern
  cues: string[],                   // real, exercise-specific form cues (replaces today's boilerplate)
  instructions: string[],
  gifUrl, videoUrl,
  unilateral: boolean,
}
```

Recommend seeding this as your own Firestore/JSON collection (own it, don't depend on an unauthenticated public mirror) — either by cleaning and re-normalizing the existing ExerciseDB data pull, or licensing/self-hosting a maintained open dataset. This removes the outage/rate-limit risk of `exercisedb-api.vercel.app` entirely.

## 13. Recommended Plan JSON Schema

```json
{
  "planId": "uuid",
  "userId": "uid",
  "weekNumber": 3,
  "weekStart": "2026-08-24",
  "previousPlanId": "uuid-of-week-2-plan",
  "generationMethod": "hybrid",
  "goal": "Athletic Performance",
  "days": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "dayOfWeek": "Monday",
      "focus": "Push",
      "exercises": [
        {
          "exerciseId": "ex_112",
          "sets": 3,
          "reps": "8-12",
          "restSeconds": 90,
          "progressionFromLastWeek": {"metric": "weight", "delta": 2.5},
          "coachNote": "Up 2.5kg from last week — you hit all sets at RPE 6."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "warmup": [...], "cooldown": [...],
  "nutrition": {...}, "recovery": {...},
  "validation": {"status": "passed", "checksRun": [...], "repairsApplied": []},
  "createdAt": "...", "aiRationale": "This week increases lower-body volume slightly based on strong completion..."
}
```

Key changes vs. today: plans are versioned and linked to their predecessor (`previousPlanId`), `weekly_split` becomes structured (`dayOfWeek`/`focus`) instead of a display string, every exercise carries its own progression delta instead of a global copy-pasted sets/reps block, and a `validation` block records what was checked so failures are auditable.

## 14. Recommended Validation Layer

Run this on **every** generated plan (deterministic-only or AI-touched) before it's written to Firestore, and never let a failure block the user — always fall back to the last-known-good deterministic output:

1. **Schema validation** (e.g. `zod`/`ajv`) — required fields present, correct types.
2. **Referential validation** — every `exerciseId` exists in the canonical exercise collection.
3. **Equipment validation** — every exercise's equipment ⊆ user's `availableEquipment` (or bodyweight).
4. **Injury/contraindication validation** — no exercise whose `contraindications` intersects the user's flagged limitations.
5. **Duplicate check** — no exercise repeated within a day; cap repeats across the week (e.g., max 2×/week per exercise) unless the split intentionally repeats a pattern.
6. **Volume/safety bounds** — total weekly sets per muscle group within a min/max band for the user's experience level; estimated session duration (`Σ sets × (work + rest)`) within a tolerance of what the user can commit.
7. **Malformed-JSON handling** (once AI is in the loop) — if the model's response fails to parse or fails schema validation, retry once with a stricter instruction, then discard the AI layer entirely and ship the deterministic engine's own valid plan rather than surfacing an error to the user.

## 15. Recommended Weekly Progression System

Read, at minimum, from `firebaseWorkoutHistory.js`: completion rate for the prior week, per-exercise weight/rep trend (already computed by `getExerciseProgress`), average RPE/difficulty, any pain/discomfort flags (needs to be added — see §16), and missed-day count. Apply simple, explainable rules first (increase load/reps when prior sets were completed comfortably; hold or reduce when RPE was high or sets were missed; substitute out any exercise flagged with pain; insert a deload week every 4–6 weeks or after a detected high-fatigue pattern) — let the AI layer phrase these as coaching notes, not invent them.

**Generation timing — use a combination, not purely on-demand:**
- A **scheduled Cloud Function** (Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub → Function) runs shortly before each user's `nextPlanDue`, proactively generating next week's plan server-side so it's ready when they open the app — this is what makes "Week 2 built from Week 1" actually automatic rather than manual.
- Keep an **on-demand "Regenerate"** action in-app for the user's own control (e.g., after they've changed equipment or goals, once that editing UI exists).
- Keep a **client-side fallback check on app open** (today's `checkPlanExpiry`) as a backstop for the scheduled job not having run yet (new signups, timezone edge cases) — but have it call the backend to generate immediately rather than just showing a "you're on your own" button.

## 16. Recommended Chatbot Architecture

Move the call server-side (Cloud Function). On each message: fetch the user's profile, current plan summary, and a compact recent-history summary (last 7–14 days' completion/RPE, not the raw full history — control token budget), build a system prompt that grounds the model in that data and instructs it to say "I don't have that information" rather than guess, and persist the conversation in `users/{uid}/chatHistory` so it survives app restarts and can be resumed. Add an explicit safety instruction for pain/medical questions (acknowledge, suggest consulting a professional, don't diagnose). This directly fixes the "why did you give me squats today?" case in the brief — the model would actually see today's assigned exercises and could answer correctly.

## 17. Chatbot + Workout Engine Integration

The chatbot should **never write directly to Firestore**. For a request like *"replace barbell squats, my gym doesn't have a barbell"*, the flow should be: chatbot recognizes an actionable request → calls a controlled backend action (`requestExerciseSubstitution(exerciseId, reason)`) → that action runs the **same** equipment/contraindication/substitute logic as plan generation → returns a proposed diff to the chat ("Swap Barbell Squat → Goblet Squat?") → user confirms → only then is Firestore updated, through the same validation layer as any other plan write. This keeps the LLM as a natural-language front door to a deterministic, auditable action, not an autonomous database editor.

## 18. Recommended Backend Changes

- Stand up Firebase Cloud Functions (zero new infra given the existing Firebase project): `generatePlan`, `regeneratePlan`, `chatWithCoach`, `requestPlanEdit` (callable), and one scheduled function for weekly rollover.
- Move `GROQ_API_KEY`/new Gemini key into Cloud Functions config or Secret Manager — remove both from `.env`/the client bundle entirely, and rotate both existing keys regardless (see §21).
- Port the deterministic engine (today's `generateWorkoutPlan.js` logic) to run server-side so it can read history without a round trip, and so it's the shared source of truth for both generation and validation.
- Audit Firestore security rules (not reviewed in this pass — the client currently reads/writes several collections directly, so rule correctness is now a hard security dependency; verify users can only read/write their own `uid`/`Users` documents).
- Own the exercise database (own Firestore collection or bundled dataset) instead of depending on an unauthenticated public mirror.

## 19. Recommended Frontend Changes

- Remove all `@env`-bundled AI keys; replace direct `axios` calls to Groq/ExerciseDB with calls to the new backend endpoints.
- Adopt React Query for all Firestore/backend reads (plan, history, chat) — replaces the current hand-rolled per-screen loading/error state and gets caching/retry for free.
- Add missing profile-edit screens for goal, equipment, experience, and weekly frequency (currently impossible to change after onboarding).
- Fix `EditRoutine.js`'s data-shape bug (`exercise.workoutDetails.sets`, not `exercise.sets`).
- Unify the exercise-selection UI/data across `AddExercise.js`, `ManualWorkout.js`, and `EquipmentWorkoutsScreen.js` onto one shared list/component and one equipment vocabulary (fixing the "Dumbells" typo and unmapped-equipment issues in the process).
- Add RPE/difficulty and pain/discomfort input to both workout-completion screens, and consolidate the two disconnected "finish workout" write paths into one.
- Persist and restore chat UI state from the (now server-persisted) chat history on screen mount.
- Add error boundaries around plan-rendering screens; remove the unconditional `console.log(userData)`.

## 20. QA Test Cases (User Journey)

| Stage | What to verify |
|---|---|
| Onboarding → Questionnaire | Every screen persists on "Next"; back-navigation pre-fills previous answers; "you can skip any question" copy in `IntroQuestionnaire` is either made true or removed (currently false — every screen blocks on empty). |
| Profile completeness gate | `Decider.js`'s `isProfileComplete` check against all 18 fields behaves correctly for partially-completed profiles; verify the (currently dead) `checking` state isn't masking a real loading gap. |
| Plan generation | Each of the 8 goal options produces a *distinct* template (today only 2 do — this should fail until §2/§9 fixes land); equipment selections map to actually-filtered exercise lists; injury/limitation text excludes matching exercises once implemented. |
| First workout | Sets/reps/rest render correctly per exercise; "Skip Exercise" behavior is intentional and recorded, not silently dropped. |
| Workout completion | Both completion paths (`PullPushDay` and `StartFullWorkoutScreen`) write to the same history store; RPE/pain fields (once added) are captured and stored. |
| Progress tracking | Statistics screen never shows placeholder data without labeling it as such; empty states render correctly for brand-new users (verify `getUserWorkoutStats` doesn't throw on an empty history — currently a plausible crash path). |
| Weekly transition | `nextPlanDue` expiry triggers proactive (not just on-open) regeneration; regeneration never destroys the prior week's completion record. |
| Next plan generation | Verify the new plan actually differs based on prior completion/performance, not just a fresh random draw. |
| AI chatbot | Ask "why did you give me squats today?" and "I couldn't complete 3 sets yesterday" — verify grounded, plan-aware answers once §16 lands; verify conversation survives app restart. |
| Returning user | Opening the app after several weeks correctly flags every stale plan rather than silently cycling through old content via the day-index modulo. |
| Error/offline | Every Firestore/network call has a user-visible error state, not just a `console.log`. |

## 21. Edge Cases (from the brief, mapped to current behavior)

- **User skips onboarding / partial questionnaire:** currently impossible to reach the app in a partial state — `Decider.js` forces completion of all 18 fields before granting access; a user who quits mid-flow restarts at the very first screen (with prior answers pre-filled, so no data loss, just repeated taps).
- **AI generation fails / times out / returns invalid JSON:** not applicable to today's rule-based generator (it degrades silently to local data instead of failing); becomes directly relevant once §9/§14 land — this is exactly what the validation-and-fallback layer must handle.
- **No workout history / one workout only / whole week skipped:** today, irrelevant to generation (history isn't read at all); after §15, must be explicitly tested — a single data point shouldn't overreact (e.g., don't deload after one high-RPE session).
- **User changes goal/equipment/frequency/difficulty:** currently impossible post-onboarding (§8 medium finding) — this is a prerequisite gap to close before "changes propagate to next week" can even be tested.
- **User deletes/restarts their plan:** no explicit "reset" flow was found; regeneration is the only reset mechanism, and it currently destroys history as noted in §5.
- **Opens app after several weeks / stale cached plan:** silently shows old content via the modulo day-index (§3) rather than clearly flagging staleness everywhere, not just on Home.
- **Offline:** most screens have no explicit offline messaging; Firestore's default offline persistence may mask this partially, but errors are frequently only `console.log`'d, not shown to the user.
- **Two simultaneous generation requests:** confirmed race condition, no lock (§5/§8 critical finding #10).

## 22. Security / Privacy Considerations

- **Rotate the exposed OpenAI and Groq keys now** — treat both as compromised regardless of anything else, since they've been sitting in a client-bundled `.env`. Remove the unused OpenAI key entirely if there's no near-term plan to use it.
- **Never ship a third-party AI/API key in a mobile bundle again** — this is the core reason for the Cloud Functions broker in §9/§18.
- **PII/health-adjacent data:** the questionnaire collects age, weight, height, dietary restrictions, allergies, and (once added) injury/pain data — treat this as sensitive. Stop the unconditional `console.log` of the full profile object, and audit Firestore security rules so users can only read/write their own documents (not verified in this pass — should be a priority follow-up).
- **Third-party data exposure:** chat messages currently go to Groq with no filtering — avoid having the client (or future backend) send unnecessary PII (full name, etc.) into chat prompts; only inject what's needed for the answer.
- **Unauthenticated external dependency:** `exercisedb-api.vercel.app` receives no user data today (good), but as an unofficial, unauthenticated public mirror it's a single point of failure with no visibility into its own data-handling or licensing terms — a reason to own the exercise catalog (§12) rather than depend on it long-term.
- Consider a basic data-retention/export/delete story given the health-adjacent nature of the data (dietary/allergy/injury fields), even if not strictly required at current scale.

## 23. Cost Considerations

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash / Flash-Lite:** free-of-charge input/output tokens on the current official free tier (verified live for this audit) — a reasonable $0 starting point for the structured personalization/validation calls, with paid-tier pricing (~$0.10–$0.30/1M input, ~$0.40–$2.50/1M output depending on model) available to fall back on if usage grows past free-tier limits (check current limits in AI Studio before committing to a launch date, since they're usage-tier dependent and not published as fixed numbers).
- **Groq:** already integrated, historically generous free tier for the small `llama-3.1-8b-instant`/`llama-3.3-70b-versatile` models — verify current limits in the Groq console for your account before relying on them for chatbot volume.
- **Cloud Functions:** usage-based, cheap at any realistic current scale for this app; the scheduled weekly-regeneration function will be one invocation per user per week, negligible cost.
- **Owning the exercise database** (own Firestore collection instead of the external mirror) removes an availability risk at effectively zero marginal cost, since the data is largely static.

## 24. Step-by-Step Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 0 — This week, independent of everything else:** rotate/revoke the exposed OpenAI and Groq keys; confirm `.env` is gitignored going forward (check git history for whether it's already committed and needs scrubbing); remove the dead OpenAI key entirely if unneeded.

**Phase 1 — Backend foundation:** stand up Cloud Functions; move the existing Groq chat call server-side unchanged (quick win — same model, just proxied, keys off the client); add Firestore-backed chat history persistence.

**Phase 2 — Harden the deterministic engine:** fix `normalizeGoal()`'s exact-match bug; wire in the currently-ignored questionnaire fields (`currentPhysique`, `energyLevel`, `foodAllergies`/`dietaryPreferences` for the nutrition section, `modifications` for exercise exclusion); unify the four exercise-vocabulary lists into one canonical set (fixes the "Dumbells" bug); add the validation layer (§14).

**Phase 3 — History-aware generation:** read `firebaseWorkoutHistory` data into generation; implement the progression rules in §15; add RPE/pain capture to both completion screens; unify the two disconnected "finish workout" write paths; switch plan writes to a transaction/merge pattern that never clobbers `completed_workouts`.

**Phase 4 — AI-assisted personalization + grounded chatbot:** add the Gemini-based personalization/validation layer from §9/§11; rebuild the chatbot per §16/§17 with profile/plan/history grounding and controlled action-calling.

**Phase 5 — Automation:** scheduled Cloud Function for proactive weekly regeneration; push notifications for plan-ready/plan-expiring.

**Phase 6 — Polish:** adopt React Query app-wide; ship the missing post-onboarding profile-edit screens; expand exercise metadata per §12; fix the remaining medium-priority bugs (`EditRoutine.js` crash, dead code, Statistics placeholder data); run the full QA/edge-case matrix in §20/§21 before calling this shipped.

## 25. Manual Workout Creation Flow ("Build Your Own Plan" Fallback)

When plan generation fails, `WorkoutGenerating.js` offers "Or create workout manually →", which opens `ManualWorkout.js`. This is a genuinely separate code path worth auditing on its own, since it's the app's only fallback when the AI/rule engine can't produce a plan.

- **UX shape:** one long single-screen scrolling form, not a step-by-step wizard — goal chips, a 1–7 "days per week" selector (auto-generates a canned Push/Pull/Legs-style split preview), a horizontal day picker, and an "Add Exercise" modal per day, plus separate modals for editing the guidelines/nutrition/recovery text blocks. No review/summary step before saving.
- **Exercise entry is a free-text form, not a database lookup.** Exercise **name** and **target muscle** are plain `TextInput`s — no autocomplete, no ExerciseDB search, no GIF/instructions (every manually-added exercise gets a canned instruction string, "Perform with proper form and control"). Only body part and equipment are constrained to chip lists. This is markedly worse than the exercise-search experience that already exists elsewhere in the app (`AddExercise.js`, reachable from `PullPushDay.js`) which *does* call the same `searchExercises`/`getExerciseCategories` functions the AI generator uses, with live filtering and GIFs — that component is simply never reused inside the manual-builder flow.
- **The good news:** whoever built `ManualWorkout.js` clearly reverse-engineered the AI generator's exact output shape. It saves to the same `workouts/{uid}` Firestore document, with the same `plan.userProfile / weekly_split / daily_workouts / warmup / cooldown / workout_guidelines / nutrition / recovery` structure and the same `"Day N: Label"` convention, and it sets `weekStart`/`nextPlanDue` identically. As a result, a manually-built plan **does render correctly** in `Home.js` and `Myplan.js`, and **does** participate in the same weekly expiry/regeneration logic as an AI-generated one — this part is a genuine, deliberate piece of integration work, not an oversight.
- **Where it breaks: the very next action a user takes.** Tapping "Edit" on any day from `Myplan.js` (manual or AI-generated plan, doesn't matter) opens `EditRoutine.js`, which reads `exercise.sets.toString()` and `exercise.reps` as flat top-level fields — but every real exercise object (manual or AI) nests these under `exercise.workoutDetails.{sets, reps}`. This throws immediately, so **editing a saved day currently crashes for every plan in the app**, manual ones included. This is the same bug already flagged in §5 as critical finding #9, and it lands squarely in this flow too.
- **Validation gaps:** only a total-exercise-count-greater-than-zero check on save; no per-day minimum (a user can dump everything into Day 1 and leave the rest empty), no duplicate-exercise detection, no cap on exercises per day, no bounds on sets/reps (a blank or non-numeric entry silently becomes a default rather than being flagged), and rest-day labels don't actually block adding exercises to a "Rest" day. No "discard changes?" confirmation on back-navigation, so a long manually-built plan can be lost with one accidental tap.
- **Orphaned adjacent screens.** `AddRoutine.js`, `StartNewWorkout.js`, `ExerciseForm.js`, and `SaveRoutineDate.js` are all registered in navigation but have **no live call sites anywhere in the app** — dead code from what looks like an earlier, incompatible "routines" data model. `AddRoutine.js` is actively dangerous if it's ever reconnected: it does a bare `.set({plan: routineData})` with no `merge: true` and a differently-shaped payload, which would wholesale replace (and corrupt) the current plan document.

**Verdict:** the manual path is a partially-built escape hatch, not a fully working alternative to AI generation. The data-contract compatibility work is solid, but the exercise-entry UX is a step backward from what already exists elsewhere in the app, validation is thin, and the first natural follow-up action (editing a day) crashes regardless of how the plan was created. Fixing the shared `EditRoutine.js` bug (§5, finding #9) and swapping `ManualWorkout.js`'s free-text exercise modal for the existing `AddExercise.js` search component would close most of the gap here.

## 26. UI/UX Improvement Recommendations

This is a code-level review of styling/structure (colors, typography, spacing, navigation chrome, accessibility) across the shared component library, the theme file, and a representative sample of screens — not a rendered visual review. `constants/theme.js` and the `CommonComponent` library do exist and are reasonably designed (they include a `Spacing` scale — `xs:4` through `xxl:48` — and a `BorderRadius` scale already); the issue is inconsistent *adoption*, not a missing design system.

**Verdict:** the Login/SignUp/Onboarding-Questionnaire flow is genuinely disciplined — it consistently uses the shared `Button`, `Heading`, `Paragraph`, `Option`, and `DoubleButton` components and theme tokens, with Formik+Yup validation and inline error text. The core app (`Home`, `Settings`, `JimAI`, `StartFullWorkoutScreen`, `TodaysFocusScreen`, `Help`, and to a lesser extent `Myplan`/`Health`/`Profile`) has drifted away from that system — each screen has re-derived its own colors, its own spacing, and its own header/loading/empty-state pattern, producing a visibly less cohesive experience than the onboarding flow gives.

**Confirmed, concrete issues (verified directly against `theme.js`/`Button.jsx`, not just inferred):**

1. **A real, live bug in the shared `Button` component.** `CommonComponent/Button.jsx` destructures a prop named `disbaled` (typo, missing the "a") instead of `disabled`, and uses it for `TouchableOpacity`'s `disabled` attribute. Most call sites accidentally match the typo (`disbaled={loading}` in `Login`, `SignUp`, `AgeQuestionnaire`, `GenderQuestionnaire`, `HeightQuestionnaire`) and so work by coincidence. But `GoalsQuestionnaire.js` (line 103) uses the *correctly spelled* `disabled={loading}` — which `Button.jsx` doesn't recognize, so **the "Continue" button on the Goals screen never actually disables or shows protection against double-tap during the async submit**, unlike its sibling questionnaire screens. Fix the prop name in `Button.jsx` once, then fix the five mismatched call sites to use `disabled` — a small, mechanical change with a real correctness payoff.
2. **A malformed color already shipped in `theme.js` itself.** `Colors.grey: "#3656565"` is a 7-character hex string — not a valid 3/4/6/8-digit color — so it won't render as intended anywhere it's used. This exact broken value was also copy-pasted into `WorkoutGenerating.js`'s local "temporary" theme fallback (added because that screen's author wasn't confident `theme.js` would resolve — see next point), so the bug is duplicated as well as broken at the source.
3. **At least six main-tab screens (`Home.js`, `Myplan.js`, `Settings.js`, `StartFullWorkoutScreen.js`, `TodaysFocusScreen.js`, `Help.js`) each paste an identical, verbatim 16-line `darkColors` object** rather than using the already-imported `Colors` from `theme.js` — and several of those same files use `Colors.x` and `darkColors.x` interchangeably a few lines apart. If the real brand color in `theme.js` ever changes, six independent copies won't follow it.
4. **Typeface mixing, not a token-naming bug.** `theme.js` legitimately defines two separate type families — short names (`Fonts.Medium`, `.Bold`, etc.) mapped to Poppins, and prefixed names (`Fonts.Montserrat_Bold`, etc.) mapped to Montserrat, plus a Lora set. Several screens (`SignUp`, `GoalsQuestionnaire`, `HeightQuestionnaire`, `GenderQuestionnaire`, `AgeQuestionnaire`, `ForgetPassword`) use *both* families in the same screen — that's a genuine visual-consistency question worth a design decision (pick one typeface per screen/section), even though it's not a technical bug. Separately, `Settings.js`/`StartFullWorkoutScreen.js`/`TodaysFocusScreen.js`/`Help.js` hardcode the raw string `"Montserrat-Bold"` instead of importing `Fonts.Montserrat_Bold` — the values match today so it isn't broken, but it bypasses the token and will silently drift if the font mapping is ever refactored.
5. **Spacing is not actually standardized despite a scale existing.** `theme.js` already exports `Spacing` (4/8/16/24/32/48) and `BorderRadius` tokens, but the sampled main-tab screens don't use them — `Home.js` has ~52 raw pixel padding/margin values, `StartFullWorkoutScreen.js` ~86, `Myplan.js` ~33 — while `RFPercentage` (used for scalable spacing elsewhere) appears zero times in `Home.js`, `TodaysFocusScreen.js`, `Health.js`, and `Profile.js`. This is an adoption gap, not a missing-tool gap.
6. **No accessibility props anywhere** (`accessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityRole`/`hitSlop` — zero matches across the sampled screens and shared components), and back-button touch targets are inconsistent (some wrapped in a proper 40×40 hit area, `Myplan.js`'s is not). `TodaysFocusScreen.js` has no back button at all, relying entirely on the OS gesture/hardware back.
7. **Header/back-button pattern is reinvented five different ways** — two different icon libraries (`AntDesign` vs `Ionicons`) and several different icon sizes/hit-box treatments across `Myplan`, `Settings`, `Help`, and the Questionnaire screens, with no shared `ScreenHeader` component.
8. **Loading/empty states have no shared component** — plain inline `ActivityIndicator`s with inconsistent sizing/color, a completely different "typing dots" pattern in `JimAI.js`, and two independently-worded one-line empty states in `Home.js`/`Myplan.js`.
9. **`KeyboardAvoidingView` is missing its `behavior` prop** in `Login.js`, `SignUp.js`, `Diets.js`, and `Challenges.js` — on iOS this wrapper does nothing without an explicit `behavior="padding"` (the correct pattern already exists in `ForgetPassword.js`/`ProfileQuestionaire.js`/`JimAI.js` and should just be copied over).

**Prioritized, no-redesign-required action list:**

1. Fix `Button.jsx`'s `disbaled`→`disabled` prop and its five mismatched call sites (real bug, one-line-per-file fix).
2. Fix `Colors.grey` in `theme.js` to a valid hex and remove the duplicated bad value from `WorkoutGenerating.js`'s local fallback (or better, delete that local fallback entirely and trust the real import).
3. Delete the six copy-pasted `darkColors` objects; point every reference at the existing `Colors` import.
4. Adopt the existing `Spacing`/`BorderRadius` tokens in the high-magic-number screens (`Home.js`, `StartFullWorkoutScreen.js`, `Myplan.js`) instead of introducing anything new.
5. Build one shared `ScreenHeader` (icon + title + optional right slot, one icon library, a real 44×44+ hit area with `hitSlop`) and use it everywhere `headerShown:false` currently forces a hand-rolled header — add it to `TodaysFocusScreen.js`, which has none today.
6. Extract one `EmptyState`/`LoadingState` component for the screens that currently invent their own.
7. Add `accessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityRole` to icon-only controls, starting with the new shared header/button components so the fix propagates everywhere at once.
8. Fix the missing `behavior` prop on the four `KeyboardAvoidingView` usages noted above.
9. Pick one typeface convention per screen (don't mix Poppins and Montserrat within the same view) as a lightweight design decision, and replace the raw `"Montserrat-Bold"`-style string literals with their `Fonts.*` token equivalents for maintainability.
