// It was never referenced anywhere else in this file (plan generation does not
// call any LLM — see GymAI_Workout_Engine_Audit.md §2), and "../config/keys"
// does not exist in this repo (it's listed in .gitignore as a place a key was
// once meant to live, but the file itself was never created/committed). It has
// been removed as part of the AI-credential security cleanup; this generator's
// behavior is unchanged.

// The `@react-native-firebase/functions` import used to live here too — the
// client called Cloud Functions via `httpsCallable(...)`. The HTTP client
// now lives in `services/workoutApi.js`, which calls the Vercel-deployed
// Express server that hosts the same workout engine.

/**
 * Workout Generator
 *
 * Design:
 * 1. Try ExerciseDB when available.
 * 2. Never let ExerciseDB failure stop workout generation.
 * 3. Fall back to local exercise catalog.
 * 4. Apply goal, experience and equipment rules.
 * 5. Never return a successful plan with zero exercises.
 *
 * PARTIAL MIGRATION NOTE (workout-engine backend task):
 * The actual plan-generation decisions this class used to make — goal
 * mapping, equipment filtering, injury/limitation filtering, template
 * selection, and random exercise selection — have moved server-side to the
 * `generateWorkoutPlan` Cloud Function (`functions/src/functions/
 * generateWorkoutPlan.ts` and its `constants/services/data` neighbors),
 * which fixed several real bugs this file had (goal fallback to "Build
 * Muscle" for 6 of 8 goals, the "Dumbells"/"Dumbbells" equipment mismatch,
 * "Advance" experience silently resolving to beginner, and zero
 * injury/limitation filtering at all). `generateExerciseDBWorkoutPlan()`
 * below now calls that Cloud Function instead of `this.generateWorkoutPlan()`.
 *
 * This class's own `generateWorkoutPlan()`/`validateWorkoutPlan()`/
 * `normalizeGoal()`/`getWorkoutTemplate()`/`selectExercisesForWorkout()`/
 * etc. methods are therefore DEAD CODE as of this change — nothing calls
 * them anymore. They have deliberately NOT been deleted in this pass: this
 * class is also the only source `searchExercises()`/`getExerciseCategories()`
 * (below, still exported and still used by `src/screens/MainScreens/
 * AddExercise.js`'s "browse exercises" screen) have for live ExerciseDB
 * access, and a large blind deletion inside a 2000+ line class risked
 * breaking that unrelated screen for no safety benefit. Extracting the
 * still-needed ExerciseDB-browsing methods into a small dedicated service
 * and deleting the rest of this class is a safe, low-risk follow-up — see
 * the workout-engine refactor report.

/**
 * Generates (and saves) the user's weekly workout plan by calling the
 * GymAI workout backend (Vercel-deployed Express server, see
 * `services/workoutApi.js`). The server reads the user's profile
 * server-side (from `Users/{uid}`, using the authenticated uid) and does
 * every goal/equipment/injury/template/exercise-selection decision there —
 * see the class docstring above for why this no longer runs locally.
 *
 * `userData` is accepted (and still typically passed by the caller) for
 * backward compatibility, but its contents are NOT sent to the backend and
 * NOT used to make any generation decision — the server re-reads the
 * user's actual saved profile itself rather than trusting whatever the
 * client currently has in memory. This also means a slightly-stale local
 * `userData` object can no longer produce a plan that doesn't match what's
 * actually saved in Firestore.
 *
 * Error codes thrown are kept identical to before this change
 * (`VALIDATION_ERROR`, `GENERATION_FAILED`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `TIMEOUT`) so
 * that `WorkoutGenerating.js`'s existing error-handling UI needs no changes.
