 * `HttpError` (or any other error) is forwarded to `next()` so the shared
 * error middleware can produce the JSON response.
 *
 * The handler receives a `CallableRequest` whose `data` is the parsed JSON
 * body and whose `auth` has been populated by the `requireFirebaseAuth`
 * middleware. `rawRequest` and `acceptsStreaming` are stubbed — the
 * workout-engine handlers never touch them.
